## Getting Started
The code and required settings have been included in this [SQL file](https://github.com/A-amon/Comic-WP-Site/blob/main/wp.sql).  
`‚ùó wp_usermeta, wp_users and wp_options are excluded from the SQL file ‚ùó`
  
These include code for:
- REST API ‚û° rate, follow titles
- Books menu ‚û° for performing CRUD on Titles and Chapters
- Additional columns in Chapters and Titles admin tables
- Basic Pods Templates code ‚û° for displaying books information
- Basic theme customisations
- Ready-to-use shortcodes

|Shortcode|Attribute(s)|Description|
|---------|------------|-----------|
|pods-override|override|Call Pods shortcode with overridden attributes <br/> E.g. <br/> If override="slug", set `slug` attribute on Pods shortcode to current page's slug|
|post-time|datetime|Show datetime passed since the provided `datetime` value (Find current post's datetime if `datetime` attribute is unset)
|post-control|taxonomy, home|Show Previous/ Next post links <br/> Set `taxonomy` attribute to relevant taxonomy name if require previous/next linking to posts with same taxonomy <br/> Set `home` attribute to "true" if require showing "Home" link on last post|
|follow-title|slug|Set "Follow" button's initial status using "Follow Button" reusable block|
|rate-title|slug|Set "Rating" input's initial status using "Rating Input" reusable block <br/> Rating defaults to 1 if no rating yet|

Add `define('PODS_SHORTCODE_ALLOW_SUB_SHORTCODES',true);` to `wp-config.php`  
  
Set your homepage to use `Home` at your Settings > Reading  

Include the [uploads](https://github.com/A-amon/Comic-WP-Site/tree/main/uploads/2022) folder in your project too because the examples/setups are using them.

## Notes

Security-wise, I used [Wordpress' Nonce](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces) to authenticate/identify the user when  
performing actions restricted for logged in users (rate, follow)  
  
This project's meant to be my playground for Wordpress so, it can be considered work-in-progress. üòâ
  
Don't hesitate to drop your suggestion/feedback in the [Issues](https://github.com/A-amon/Comic-WP-Site/issues) section.  
I'll get to them when I have time. üòÇ
